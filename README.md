# Air quality analysis

## Case study
We observed the pollution levels in Lombardia (Italy) from 2006 to 2018. We decided to study 2 different relations:<br><br>
- Relation between pollution and weather conditions<br>
- Relation between pollution and deseases<br><br>
We made a dashboard using plotly, a powerful Python module.
Here is the list of the pollutants we analyzed:<br>
- PM 10<br>
- PM 2.5<br>
- NO2<br>
- O3<br>
- SO2<br>
- CO 8h<br>
- C6h6
## Weather conditions
We checked if different weather conditions affected the pollution levels in Lombardia.<br>
Using the dashboard, a user can choose the pollutant and a weather condition between:<br>
- Humidity<br>
- Temperature<br>
- Wind speed<br>
- Global radiation<br>
- Precipitation<br><br>
The dashboard will show the "scatter plot" between the chosen elements.
## Deseases
We checked if a specified pollutant affected the number of deaths for a given desease in Lombardia.<br>
Using the dashboard, a user can choose the pollutant and a desease.<br>
The dashboard will show the scatter plot between that elements.
## Other tabs of the dashboard
- General Tab<br>
Here we displayed a "choropleth map" that clearly shows which province is the most polluted, a "line chart" that shows the pollution trend among the years and a "donut chart" that shows the most prevalent pollutant.<br>
- Specific Tab<br>
Here we displayed an "interactive choropleth map" that permits the user to click to a specific province and analyze the pollution levels for that province in the specified year. Based on the user's click the dashboard shows also a "spider graph" that highlights the pollutant level among the months of the selected year, a "donut chart" like the one explained above that shows the most prevalent pollutant in the selected year and finally a "box plot" and a "area chart" that show the distribution of the pollutant level and if the pollutant exceeded the legally admitted limits.

## Datasets used
We took the datasets about the deseases from ISTAT<br>
- (https://www.istat.it/).<br><br>
We took the datasets about the weather conditions and the pollution levels from ARPA Lombardia<br>
